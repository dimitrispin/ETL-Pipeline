# ETL-Pipeline
In this mini project we will simulate the workflow of a pipeline using Jupyter Notebook.
We will take data from an API and most specifically from the http://universities.hipolabs.com
We will extract the data from there, Transform them into a pandas dataframe and do necessary and optional filtering,
and finally Load them into a dummy database.
